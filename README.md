# Lake Nixon Schedule App

A planning app for the Lake Nixon Summer Camp in Little Rock, AR.

This app is designed to make planning for each day of camp easier for the camp administrators and make this information easily accessible to parents and camp councelors who want to know what the different groups of campers are doing everyday. 



Users log in and it separates them based on if they are administrators or users.
